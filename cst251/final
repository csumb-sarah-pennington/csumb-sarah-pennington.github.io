    <h1> The Reality of Recycling </h1>
    <p> Recycling is an amazing thing 
      when it works like we think it does. 
      However, most times it sin't even 
      lose to how we think recylcing happens. 
      Occording to the Smithsonian Ocean, 
      “out of the millions of tons of plastic 
      produced each year, only about 5 percent 
      of it is reclaimed. A large amount of 
      plastic, about eight million metric 
      tons every year, ends up in the ocean, 
      polluting the water and endangering marine
      life.” This means for every peice of 
      trash we think we're recycling, 
      it is most likely going into the ocean.
      This not only endangers our beloved marine 
      life but also our selves. These effects are 
      discussed deeper in other pages. </p>
